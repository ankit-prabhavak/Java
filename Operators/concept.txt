Types of operator in Java
Java provides several types of operators that can be used to perform various operations on variables and values.
Here are some of the most commonly used operators in Java:

1. Arithmetic Operators(+, -, *, /, %)
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. Assignment Operators(=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=)
Assignment operators are used to assign a value to a variable.

3. Comparison Operators(>, <, ==, !=, >=, <=)
Comparison operators are used to compare two values and determine whether they are equal or not.

4. Logical Operators(&&, ||, !)
Logical operators are used to perform logical operations such as AND, OR, and NOT.

5. Bitwise Operators(<<, >>, &, ^, ~, >>>)
Bitwise operators are used to perform operations on the bits of a binary number.

6. Ternary Operator(?)
The ternary operator is a shorthand for a simple if-else statement.

7. Increment and Decrement Operators(++, --)
Increment and decrement operators are used to increment or decrement the value of a variable by 1.
